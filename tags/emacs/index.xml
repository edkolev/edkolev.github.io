      <description>This post is intended to present a minimal example of setting up emacs with evil as well as a few evil plugins.
The emacs ecosystem is constantly changing, and evil and its plugins, being part of that ecosystem, are changing as well. Hence, the snippet below will be updated as I see fit.
Care is taken to ensure the evil packages are lazy-loaded.
;; load package manager, add the Melpa package registry (require &amp;#39;package) (add-to-list &amp;#39;package-archives &amp;#39;(&amp;#34;melpa&amp;#34; .</description>

      <description>The :only ex command is one of my most used ones. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it can be tweaked so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t only (pun intended) hide all the other windows, but it restores them when re-executed. it You can think of it as a zoom/un-zoom command.
(use-package zygospore :ensure t :commands zygospore-toggle-delete-other-windows :init (evil-ex-define-cmd &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; &amp;#39;zygospore-toggle-delete-other-windows)) The above snippet uses the zygospore package, which is but a thin wrapper around emacs core functionality.</description>

      <description>This post will show how to add simple make-based testing support for running automated emacs `ert` tests.
The following utilities will be available on the development machine:
 `make update` will install the development dependencies `make compile` will compile the .el files `make test` will run the `ert` tests `make clean` will remove the compiled files  The Travis build will fail with an error when:
 a compilation warning or error occurs an automated test fails  This will be the resulting directory structure, where `.</description>

      <description>TL;DR This January I stopped using vim after years of sharpening my vim setup because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand this very commit.
The &amp;ldquo;reason&amp;rdquo; In my mother tongue there are two different words for &amp;ldquo;reason&amp;rdquo; with significant differences in their meaning. The first one &amp;ldquo;причина&amp;rdquo;, is used to describe an event or more commonly, a series of events which lead to what usually turns out to be a bad situation. The other one &amp;ldquo;повод&amp;rdquo;, describes the very last event, the final straw which lead to the event.</description>
