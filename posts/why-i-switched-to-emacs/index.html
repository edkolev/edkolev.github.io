<h1>Why I switched to Emacs</h1>

Sep. 8, 2017


<br/><br/>
<p>After years of using Vim as my primary editing tool&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>This January I stopped using vim after years of sharpening my vim
setup because I couldn&rsquo;t understand this very <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-slash/commit/5e9d77b6">commit</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-reason">The &ldquo;reason&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In my mother tongue there are two different words for &ldquo;reason&rdquo; with
significant differences in their meaning. The first one &ldquo;причина&rdquo;, is
used to describe an event or more commonly, a series of events which
lead to what usually turns out to be a bad situation. The other one
&ldquo;повод&rdquo;, describes the very last event, the final straw which lead to
the event.</p>
<p>This commit, this patch of code was the last straw, it was the reason I
would stop using my sharpened saw, my tool of trade, my Vim:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-slash/commit/5e9d77b6">https://github.com/junegunn/vim-slash/commit/5e9d77b6</a></p>
<p>I had been following the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-slash">vim-slash</a> repo for some time because I had a
similar functionality in my vimrc&hellip; and because I find this
particular project interesting. I like following interesting projects.</p>
<p>That commit fixed an issue that I had been experiencing
myself. However, even after years of using Vim and writing VimL I had
no idea how this patch would address the issue.</p>
<p>On one hand, this commit seems like such an elegant solution to the
problem - with just a few lines of code, the issue is completely
fixed.  On the other hand, however, this smells like such an ugly hack
that.</p>
<p>Up until that moment, I had been seeing VimL as an elegant solution,
such beauty, so similar to all the scripting languages I&rsquo;m (painfully)
familiar with&hellip; but not more. I had seen the true side of it and I
couldn&rsquo;t see it in any other way.</p>
<h2 id="the-cosmic-microwave-background-radiation">The cosmic microwave background radiation</h2>
<p>Like the cosmic microwave background radiation, emacs-lisp has been
there all along, waiting for me to discover it. And now that I have, I
can&rsquo;t go back, I can&rsquo;t deny its existence, I can&rsquo;t go back to VimL.</p>
<p>Like seeing the &ldquo;SH&rdquo;, as in Steven Hawking, in the
cosmic microwave background radiation - once you see it, you can&rsquo;t
un-see it.</p>
