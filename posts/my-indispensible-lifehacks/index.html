<h1>My indispensable lifehack</h1>

Feb. 7, 2025


<br/><br/>
<p>This is a reflection of the practices I strive to follow in order to have a higher quality of
life, taking into account the multiple fascets of life&rsquo;s challenges. Actually, it&rsquo;s just one
practice.</p>
<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR;</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s <strong>Physical activity</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Life is chain of challenges, which we tackle using a series of practices, many of which are
repetitive:</p>
<ul>
<li>brush teeth</li>
<li>post on social media</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this post my aim is to share my Most impactful, ongoing, repetitive practices, which have
been universally beneficial to <strong>my</strong> life, and to those <strong>around</strong> me. The list is intentionally
short, as it has been distilled to the most influential practices. I would have gladly included
more life hacks, if only I had discovered more.</p>
<p>For a practice to make it into this list, it is required to have a broad range of benefits, not
isolated to any specific challenge. Hence, as much as I want, I will not include <a href="/posts/why-im-still-using-emacs/">Emacs</a>, even
though it has had an immense impact on how I spend time in front of a computer (both work and
leisure).</p>
<p>With those restrictions, the list is actually a single point - working out. Or more generally:
<strong>being physically active</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-started">How it started</h2>
<p>A few years back, I switched employers and was trying to catch up with my new colleagues, fill
any missing skills I needed for my new role. At that time it was common to see sheets of paper
here and there around the office, trying to teach employees useful little tricks to help with
work. I guess Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2007/01/introducing-testing-on-toilet.html">Testing on the Toilet</a> was the inspiration for such publications. Most
of these publications were about basic engineering practices like unit tests, code reviews. But
not all&hellip;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, one of the leaflets was about <strong>working out</strong>. It stated that employees are
encouraged to work out, it stated my employer actually wanted me to be physically active. I was
not expecting that - it stated that physically active employees are more productive than the
others.</p>
<p>ðŸ˜³ &lt;&ndash; my reaction.</p>
<p>At that time, I was all about increasing my productivity, becoming that 10X developer (which is
a nice myth by the way&hellip; I was young, naive&hellip; don&rsquo;t judge). So I did not need a second
opinion, I started working out!</p>
<p>Now, 5+ years later, I consider this one of the best decisions in my life! To get an idea about
the magnitude of this statement - I consider my decision to have a family (wife, kids) another
one!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-physical-activity">What is Physical Activity</h2>
<p>My own definition of being physically active? I consider someone physically active if they
practice one or more activities which cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full body - most muscles of the body should be involved</li>
<li>Progressive challenge - the activity should be able to scale up with time, i.e. more
intensity, density, difficulty, time, etc.</li>
<li>Consistency - I&rsquo;d say 1-5 times per week. Could be more or less, depending on the intensity</li>
<li>Skill - the mind should be challenged to learn, and improve</li>
</ul>
<p>My physical activity of choice has been body-weight workout, but there are many other options,
to name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Football</li>
<li>Running</li>
<li>Dancing</li>
<li>Tennis</li>
<li>Gym</li>
<li>Knitting</li>
<li>Or even better - a combination of a few</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing a combination of activities offers unique benefits, for example activities can be
easily cycled depending on external factors, like the weather. You could play mostly football in
the warm moths, and occasionally go to the gym. And during the cold months, you could mostly go
to the gym, and play football if you get the chance.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-but-also-negative-consequences">Benefits but also negative consequences</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed a wide range of benefits of practicing a physical activity. Still, I&rsquo;m sure
different people would experience different changes. I&rsquo;m also sure the majority of the
experiences/changes would be positive - yes, not all would be positive. It&rsquo;s actually very
likely that you get injured (among other risks), so there are definitely downsides.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m confident anyone can choose an activity which can provide a wide range of
benefits, with minimum risk, minimum downsides.</p>
<p>Regarding the benefits, I&rsquo;ve noticed many. But note it&rsquo;s just that - <strong>I&rsquo;ve noticed</strong> them. The
benefits are consistent with what I have researched, however, I have not verified them in any
pseudo scientific way. So take them for what they are - my subjective personal observations,
that I&rsquo;m 100% confident in, I do recommend, but can&rsquo;t back up with scientific evidence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discipline</li>
<li>Persistence</li>
<li>Patience</li>
<li>Tracking progress</li>
<li>Being fit</li>
<li>Increased energy level</li>
<li>Health resilience</li>
<li>Better mood</li>
<li>Energy</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth going into details about each on of these, especially for some of the less intuitive
ones like &ldquo;discipline&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll consider a follow-up deep dive post about some of these.</p>
<h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable mentions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sleep</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Nutrition</li>
<li>Hobby</li>
<li><a href="/posts/why-i-switched-to-emacs/">Emacs</a></li>
<li>Flexibility</li>
</ul>
<p>I firmly believe all of the above can result in amazing benefits, and I personally do practice
many of them in one way or another. However, some do require significant sacrifices, so they
did not meet the bar for being my Single Most Influential Life Hack, that I can recommend to
anyone.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I would recommend practicing some form of physical activity to everybody - regardless of age,
profession, schedule. Because I&rsquo;m 100% convinced of the benefits!</p>
