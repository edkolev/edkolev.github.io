<h1>Why I&#39;m still using Emacs</h1>

Dec. 7, 2024


<br/><br/>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Emacs for 8 years as of now, and Vim for 4-5 before
that. Everybody I&rsquo;ve ever worked with knows very well <strong>what</strong> I use&hellip;
but not necessarily <strong>why</strong> I use it. So why?</p>
<p>This post will try to answer this question that I so often get - why
Emacs? The question makes sense - there are so many options, so many
IDEs available. Some of them are pretty much the norm, like VS Code
and JetBrains.</p>
<h2 id="but-it-s-not-just-emacs">But it&rsquo;s not just Emacs</h2>
<p>Actually I use both Emacs and Vim&hellip; and a bunch of other tools in
day-to-day coding. For example tmux, bash, git, ripgrep. Arguably,
every tool is an integral part of my workflow, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense
to look at individual tools, instead, everything together is what
makes my software development experience what it is.</p>
<p>Still, let&rsquo;s focus on the big question - why Emacs?</p>
<p>This post will try to provide an objective analysis of the pros and
cons, hoping to be as objective as possible. However, with me being
me, and my biases being my biases, it&rsquo;s unlikely I&rsquo;ll be able to
really do an objective analysis&hellip; But here it goes anyway.</p>
<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR;</h2>
<p>I like it. I like so many aspects of using Emacs - from day-to-day
writing in it, to periodically checking what new features have been
implemented in the core, and the ecosystem. I enjoy org-mode (I&rsquo;m
writing this post in org-mode), evil, Elisp, magit to name a few. But
even more I&rsquo;m impressed with the life of the <strong>project</strong> - In March 2025
<strong>the project will turn 40&hellip; years!</strong></p>
<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learning a Lisp dialect, Elisp, has been a great experience for me.
I enjoy learning programming languages, I enjoy learning in general.
Since Lisps are so different from my day-to-day programming
languages, it was a mind-bending experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personalised workflow. I know what I want from my development
environment, and I can achieve it with Emacs. The level of
personalisation is amazing, so many things can be customized. An
example: I like modal editing, so I use <a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil">evil</a>. I use RET (enter key)
to save the file - this is probably the most often used key for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open source, and warm community. I&rsquo;ve contributed <a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/log/?qt=author&amp;q=evgeni+kolev">multiple times</a> to
Emacs. I don&rsquo;t consider myself a strong Elisp programmer, however,
the community has been so responsive, so welcoming, I&rsquo;ve practically
been guided multiples times to make my contributions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>
<p>The Cons here not really Cons for my. I&rsquo;m listing them because from my
discussions with fellow engineers, these are generally seen as
negatives. For example, I enjoy doing research on how <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">LSP</a> / <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/">DAP</a> work.
However, I acknowledge most people prefer having an IDE which just
works, without exposing under-the-hood details like LSP or DAP.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Requires maintenance. My Emacs configuration is quite big (a few
thousand lines), so as the ecosystem evolves, I occasionally do some
housekeeping to keep it up-to-date, and make sure I&rsquo;m taking
advantage of latest features (e.g. native compilation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires research. Like mentioned above, LSP or DAP is a good
example. Also, Emacs has different packages for both LSP (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot">eglot</a>
VS <a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode">lsp-mode</a>) and DAP (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/svaante/dape">dape</a> VS <a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode">dap-mode</a>), just picking one of
these requires some work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires in-depth knowledge. Things <strong>will</strong> break. For example Go&rsquo;s
<a href="https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/README.md">gopls</a> might be upgraded and stop working as a result, which will
require some intervention to fix. The ecosystem is huge, and the
ecosystem does not stop evolving. Things break, and someone has to
fix them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I never mentioned speed, speed is not a factor for me. I acknowledge my
speed for certain tasks can be extremely fast, however, some other
tasks can be much slower. Still, this does not make much of a
difference from my experience. Coding or reading/exploring code are
just a small part of the daily work. I believe the limiting factor is
not the editor/IDE, but the human factor.</p>
<p>I make an analogy with driving a nice car - it&rsquo;s not faster than any
other modern car, assuming speed limit are obeyed.</p>
<p>Still, driving the nice car is more pleasant, more enjoyable.</p>
<p>This is Emacs for me - pleasant, enjoyable!</p>
