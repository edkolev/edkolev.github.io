<p>Working in an all-remote company has always been an interesting
thought exercise to me. Would it work for me? Would it work for the
company? At what cost?</p>

<h2 id="pluses">Pluses</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s settle on the positives first, starting with the big one: one
could work with his pajamas all day! While this might not sound
serious, it implies a couple of other subtleties - the office is where
you when it to be. You want to work from you couch? Sure. How about
that cosy coffee shop nearby? Of course. Maybe the coffee shop which
is right next to the park, and now that the park is mentioned, it
doesn&rsquo;t sound as such a bad office idea either. Definitely! And maybe
occasionally you would just go to the company office and meet up with
the people you work with because you are a human being, just like
them, and you do feel the occasional need to socialize. Hum.. sorry,
this won&rsquo;t work - &ldquo;all-remote&rdquo;, remember? There isn&rsquo;t such a thing as
a company office when doing all-remote. Not only that, but the chances
of too many people working in the same time zone as you are slim&hellip;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to the positives, though, this is the <code>pluses</code> section!</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, your company would have a huge pool of engineers to chose
from. How big? People from all over the world! That big! That&rsquo;s a
definite win for you when considering whether to join such a company -
you won&rsquo;t ever have to worry about whether relocating makes sense for
you in this phase of your life.</p>

<p>Now that joining such a company is mentioned - hiring is likely to be
&ldquo;special&rdquo; - expect an intense series of interviews, each testing your
ability to work in a remote team. You might get chat-only interviews
since chat will likely be the most widely and commonly used
communication channel for the whole company. It makes sense to have
all your interviews online, sending text messages only. No voice, no
video.</p>

<h2 id="negatives">Negatives</h2>

<p>Working by yourself for long periods of time seems like the most
obvious challenge. I guess for myself it would be no more than a month
before I feel a need for in-person human interactions. Nevertheless,
this need varies widely between people. I can easily imagine someone
who never really start craving a face-to-face dialogue. Your mileage
may vary, just be careful not to fall into the trap that is working
with your pajamas, all day, every day&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>For the company, having a global pool of talent is an obvious win.
Nevertheless, special care has to be taken when figuring out how many
people in the company will be remote and how many - in an office. I
don&rsquo;t believe you can mix and match here, so the only viable, long
term option in my (limited, biased) opinion, is all-remote. This post
is about all-remote companies so I won&rsquo;t bother going into details why
a hybrid model wouldn&rsquo;t be easy, if at all, to pull.</p>

<p>For the individual, working with people from different parts of the
world, different time zones, seems like a lot of fun. Until you need
to have an all-hands meeting, that is. If you&rsquo;re slightly lucky
however, you could easily have top-notch colleagues from all around
Earth, and be able to learn a lot from them. And all from the comfort
of your own couch!</p>
