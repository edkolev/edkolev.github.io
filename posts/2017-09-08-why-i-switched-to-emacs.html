<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>This January I stopped using vim after years of sharpening my vim setup because I couldn’t understand this very <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-slash/commit/5e9d77b6375ad3f24e9208fa7bd7dd0b1d1a0cc0">commit</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-reason">The “reason”</h2>
<p>In my mother tongue there are two different words for “reason” with significant differences in their meaning. The first one “причина”, is used to describe an event or more commonly, a series of events which lead to what usually turns out to be a bad situation. The other one “повод”, describes the very last event, the final straw which lead to the event.</p>
<p>This commit, this patch of code was the last straw, it was the reason I would stop using my sharpened saw, my tool of trade, my Vim:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-slash/commit/5e9d77b6375ad3f24e9208fa7bd7dd0b1d1a0cc0">https://github.com/junegunn/vim-slash/commit/5e9d77b6</a></p>
<p>I had been following the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-slash">vim-slash</a> repo for some time because I had a similar functionality in my vimrc… and because I find this particular project interesting. I like following interesting projects.</p>
<p>That commit fixed an issue that I had been experiencing myself. However, even after years of using Vim and writing VimL I had no idea how this patch would address the issue.</p>
<p>On one hand, this commit seems like such an elegant solution to the problem - with just a few lines of code, the issue is completely fixed. On the other hand, however, this smells like such an ugly hack that.</p>
<p>Up until that moment, I had been seeing VimL as an elegant solution, such beauty, so similar to all the scripting languages I’m (painfully) familiar with… but not more. I had seen the true side of it and I couldn’t see it in any other way.</p>
<h2 id="the-cosmic-microwave-background-radiation">The cosmic microwave background radiation</h2>
<p>Like the cosmic microwave background radiation, emacs-lisp has been there all along, waiting for me to discover it. And now that I have, I can’t go back, I can’t deny its existence, I can’t go back to VimL.</p>
<p>Like seeing the “SH”, as in Steven Hawking, in the cosmic microwave background radiation - once you see it, you can’t un-see it.</p>
